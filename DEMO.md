## 60-Second Demo Script

### Opening (0-10s)
"Welcome to the Rig Veda Sacred Atlas - an interactive map that brings the geography of the Vedic world to life."

### Feature 1: Interactive Map (10-20s)
"Click any marker to explore sacred rivers like Sarasvati, mountains like Mūjavat, and tribal lands. Each location is linked to actual Rig Veda verses with Griffith's public domain translation."

### Feature 2: Theme Filters (20-35s)
"Use the theme sliders to filter locations by their significance. Slide 'Dawn' to see where Uṣas hymns cluster. Increase 'Soma' to highlight mountain regions. Watch the map dynamically update as you adjust themes like Rain, Battle, Fire, and Ṛta."

### Feature 3: Curated Paths (35-50s)
"Select a curated journey like 'Journey of Sacred Rivers' or 'Dawn Across the Vedic World.' The map animates a path connecting related locations, creating a narrative tour through the Rig Veda's geography."

### Closing (50-60s)
"Every pin shows uncertainty levels for disputed locations, ensuring scholarly rigor. Zero data collection, fully accessible, and mobile-friendly. Explore the Rig Veda like never before."
