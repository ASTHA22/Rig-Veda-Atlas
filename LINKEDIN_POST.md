## 🎯 Version 1: Professional & Engaging

🕉️ Excited to share my submission for the Rig Veda Hackathon - **Rig Veda Sacred Atlas**!

What if you could explore the Rig Veda not just as text, but as an interactive geographical journey?

🗺️ **What I built:**
An interactive map that brings Vedic geography to life. Click any location to see the actual Rig Veda verses that mention it - complete with translations and references.

✨ **Key Features:**
• 🎨 Theme Filters - Explore by Dawn, Rain, Fire, Soma, Battle, or Cosmic Order (Ṛta)
• 🛤️ Curated Journeys - Follow paths like "Journey of Sacred Rivers" or "Path of Sacred Fire"
• 📜 Verse Citations - Every location backed by actual Rig Veda verses
• 🎯 Uncertainty Indicators - Transparent about disputed geographical locations
• 🌓 Dark/Light Mode - Beautiful design for comfortable viewing

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Your Vercel URL]
💻 **GitHub:** https://github.com/ASTHA22/Rig-Veda-Atlas

Built with React, TypeScript, and Leaflet. 100% frontend, no backend needed!

This project combines my passion for ancient texts with modern web technology. It's been an incredible journey exploring the intersection of sacred geography and interactive design.

## 🎯 Version 2: Story-Driven

🕉️ "Where exactly was the Sarasvati River? Which mountains did the Vedic seers call home?"

These questions fascinated me while reading the Rig Veda. So I built something to answer them.

Introducing **Rig Veda Sacred Atlas** - my submission for the Rig Veda Hackathon 🗺️

**The Problem:**
Most Rig Veda resources are text-heavy. The geographical context - where these verses were composed, which rivers they mention, which mountains they describe - gets lost.

**My Solution:**
An interactive map where you can:
• Click any location to see its Rig Veda verses
• Filter by themes (Dawn, Rain, Fire, Soma, Battle, Cosmic Order)
• Follow curated journeys through the Vedic world
• Share specific paths with others

**Why it matters:**
Geography isn't just background - it's integral to understanding the Rig Veda. The rivers weren't just water sources; they were deities. The mountains weren't just landscapes; they were sacred spaces.
